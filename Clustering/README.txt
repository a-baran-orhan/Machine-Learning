Implementation of clustering algorithms
"""ADEM BARAN ORHAN"""

Builded K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering models to perform an unsupervised clustering by using given data.

Data cleaning done like handling missing values, encoding categorical features, extracting useful features by using existing features, handling outliers

Data Preprocessing scaling the features, performing dimensionality reduction

Clustering Used K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering Algorithms. Appled Elbow Method to determine the number of clusters.

Silhouette Scores Silhouette Scores for all of data points.
