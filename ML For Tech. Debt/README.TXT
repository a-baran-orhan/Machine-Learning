In this projects( first of mine ), I implement a program to solve a real-world machine learning
problem with real-world data. In this project, I used Python data science
libraries such as; Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. In the end, there were three types of
machine learning models.

Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor used to describe the lack of software quality in the product.
It provides a valuable indicator to track software product quality throughout development
and maintenance. It defines the invariance of delayed technical development activities to
receive short-term repayments. The consequences related to these skipped activities are ac-
cumulated in the software, and it is called as 'debt.' If there is too much technical debt that
is accumulated, it causes low software quality, pointing to the initiation of design and code
quality problems. Because development will slow down, maintainability of the software will
be difficult. To fix these quality problems, it requires extra effort for their mitigation. TD is
a measure of the effort needed for fixing these problems in the future and used as a measure
of quality. Therefore, the higher value of TD for a software product means more unresolved
quality problems included in, and lower overall quality. Since measuring TD directly can be
difficult, we propose to analyze whether there is a relation between TD with internal and
external metrics.

DATASET
Real world dataset (https://zenodo.org/record/4265301#.X84QNLOhlPY)
that consists of information about 50 open source Android project. In this dataset, 
16 different metrics of the each project.these metrics are as "external",
"internal", and "TD" metrics.
